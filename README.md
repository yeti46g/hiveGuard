### About

Since last December (2019), Asian giant horents have been sighted in Washington State. These two-inch long wasps pray on bees. A few of them could wipe out an entire bee colony in a matter of hours. The potential spreading of this invasive species could pose serious threat to the declining bee population in the US. In response to this threat, I am creating a real-time 'murder hornet' detection model that could work on a single-board computer such as a Raspbery Pi. The envision of the product is to be integrated with a camera-based smart monitoring system installed at honey bee hive entrance. Or it can serve as the computer vision part of a smart trap to catch the hornets.
